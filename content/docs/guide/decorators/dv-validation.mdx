title: "decoValidation"
description: Function that validates all decorated fields of an instance, applying each rule and collecting errors.
---

The `decoValidation()` function is responsible for validating all decorated properties in a class instance. It applies the associated validation functions and returns a `Promise` that resolves if there are no validation errors or rejects with a map of errors if any are found.

## Basic Usage

```ts
import "reflect-metadata";
import { decoValidation, DvText, DvNumber } from "decoval";

class User {
  @DvText()
  name: string;

  @DvNumber()
  age: number;
}

async function validateUser() {
  const user = new User();
  user.name = "";
  user.age = "not a number" as any;

  try {
    await decoValidation(user);
  } catch (errors) {
    console.log(errors);
    // {
    //   name: ['The "name" field cannot be empty'],
    //   age: ['The "age" field must be a valid number']
    // }
  }
}
```

**Summary**

Applies all registered validations to a decorated class instance and returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on validation results.
